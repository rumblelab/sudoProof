"To Whom It May Concern,

In addition to the attached statements from Coinbase, I also hold 5.1 BTC in a self-custodied wallet for which no third-party institution can provide a statement.

To prove my ownership of these assets, I have provided a cryptographic proof of funds. This document contains a list of my Bitcoin addresses and a cryptographic signature that proves my exclusive control over them.

You can view and re-verify the authenticity of this proof at the following secure link: https://your-app.com/proof/abc123xyz. The verification process uses established Bitcoin cryptographic standards.

Sincerely,

John Doe"
